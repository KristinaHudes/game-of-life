# 🧬 Game of Life (React/Redux-Toolkit + TypeScript)

Welcome to the **Game of Life**! This project implements John Conway's classic **cellular automaton**, known as the Game of Life, using **React**, **Redux-Toolkit**, and **TypeScript**. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the simulation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automatic Start**: The simulation begins automatically upon the first page load.
- **Grid Size Selection**: Choose between three different grid sizes for a customized experience.
- **Simulation Controls**:
  - **Play**: Start the simulation.
  - **Pause**: Pause the simulation.
  - **Clear**: Reset the grid to an empty state.
  - **Fast/Slow**: Adjust the simulation speed.
  - **Seed**: Generate a random initial grid state.

## 🛠️ Technologies
This project leverages the following technologies:

- **React**: For building the user interface components.
- **Redux-Toolkit**: For state management and simulation control.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and clean, maintainable code.

## 💻 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 📋 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+)
- npm or yarn (package managers)

### ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KristinaHudes/game-of-life.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd game-of-life
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### ▶️ Running the Project
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or, with yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🖥️ Usage
- Use the **controls** to interact with the simulation (play, pause, clear, etc.).
- Adjust the grid size and speed for a more dynamic or relaxed simulation.
- Explore the random **Seed** feature for new starting patterns.
